        "Created DamageWhileUnconsciousResult struct with State and FailuresAdded",
        "Implemented MakeDeathSave() with D&D 5e roll interpretation (1=2 failures, 2-9=1 failure, 10-19=1 success, 20=regain consciousness)",
        "Implemented TakeDamageWhileUnconscious() (1 failure for normal, 2 for crit)",
        "Wrote 19 comprehensive tests covering all roll outcomes and edge cases",
        "All tests passing (19/19 death save tests + 12 existing saving throw tests)",
        "Fixed linter issues (unused parameter, line length)"
