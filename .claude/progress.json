        "Created combatabilities package at rulebooks/dnd5e/combatabilities/",

      "notes": "Phase 2 complete. The combatabilities package provides infrastructure for universal combat abilities. Named 'combatabilities' to avoid conflict with existing 'abilities' package (which contains ability scores STR/DEX/etc). The CombatAbility interface follows the same pattern as Feature and Action interfaces."
