Six sub-modules that implement the D&D/RPG modifier pipeline infrastructure.
All depend on `core` and `events`; none depend on `rulebooks/dnd5e`.

## mechanics/effects — B

**Path:** `mechanics/effects/`
**Module:** `github.com/KirkDiggler/rpg-toolkit/mechanics/effects`

Shared infrastructure for conditions and proficiencies. Provides
`EffectTracker`, effect behaviors, and a composed condition base type.

### Key types
- `EffectTracker` — tracks applied/removed effects with deduplication
- `ComposedEffect` — base struct for effects that compose multiple behaviors
- `BehaviorFn` — function type for effect behavior handlers

### Known gaps
- Tests are flat (`TestXxx`) not suite pattern — inconsistent with repo standard
- No doc distinguishing when to use `mechanics/effects` vs. `mechanics/conditions` directly. The answer: `effects` is the shared infrastructure; `conditions` consumes it.
- No go.mod issues. Clean dependency tree.

---

## mechanics/conditions — B

**Path:** `mechanics/conditions/`
**Module:** `github.com/KirkDiggler/rpg-toolkit/mechanics/conditions`

Condition manager plus simple/enhanced condition types.

### Key types
- `Manager` — tracks active conditions per entity; handles apply/remove/query
- `SimpleCondition` — basic BusEffect with apply/remove handlers
- `EnhancedCondition` — SimpleCondition with stacking and duration support

### go.mod state (issue #617)
`mechanics/conditions/go.mod` carries four committed `replace` directives.
Resolution deferred to **issue #617**: the source uses old-API events symbols
(`events.Event`, `events.HandlerFunc`, `event.Context().GetString` /
`.AddModifier()`) that don't exist in any published events version. The
replace directives point `events => ../../events` so the build can find these
symbols. Closing #617 means rewriting conditions against the new typed-topic
events API (`TypedTopic[T]`, `ChainedTopic[T]`, `BusEffect`, `StagedChain`)
— a real refactor, not a version bump. The 4-class playtest doesn't exercise
this module (it consumes `rulebooks/dnd5e/conditions` instead, which already
runs against the new API), so this is on hold until the base module is
needed.

### Coverage note
Good behavior coverage at the `rulebooks/dnd5e` level (raging, dodging,
unconscious, etc. all exercised in integration tests), but the base
`Manager`/`SimpleCondition`/`EnhancedCondition` tests are flat and not
suite-pattern.

---

## mechanics/resources — B+

**Path:** `mechanics/resources/`
**Module:** `github.com/KirkDiggler/rpg-toolkit/mechanics/resources`

Resource pools and counters for finite game resources.

### Key types
- `Pool` — finite resource with max, current, refill-on-rest semantics (spell slots, ki points)
- `Counter` — simpler counter (rage uses, second wind)

### Status
No go.mod issues. Tests cover happy paths. Edge cases (refill to zero,
consume past limit) not explicitly tested, but the pool logic is
straightforward enough that this is low risk.

---

## mechanics/features — C

**Path:** `mechanics/features/`
**Module:** `github.com/KirkDiggler/rpg-toolkit/mechanics/features`

Feature loader infrastructure. The base module provides the routing layer;
rulebooks provide implementations.

### Key types
- `FeatureData` interface — gives loaders access to a feature's `Ref()` and `JSON()`
- `Loader` — routes `FeatureData` to the correct implementation by ref
- `SimpleFeature` — a basic feature that fires a callback on activation

### go.mod: no issues
Clean dependencies — only `core`.

### Critical gap (issue #615 adjacent)
`loader.go`, `feature.go`, `simple_feature.go` — **zero test files in the base
module.** Only `mock/` exists. The feature loader routing logic and error
paths are untested at the module level. Indirect coverage exists through
`rulebooks/dnd5e/features`, but a bug in `Loader.Route()` error handling
would not be caught by running `cd mechanics/features && go test ./...` —
that command prints "no test files."

Grade would move to B with tests that exercise the loader routing and error
paths.

## mechanics/proficiency — B

**Path:** `mechanics/proficiency/`
**Module:** `github.com/KirkDiggler/rpg-toolkit/mechanics/proficiency`

Proficiency system. Tracks what an entity is proficient with and calculates
proficiency-bonus-adjusted modifiers.

### Key types
- `Proficiency` interface
- `SimpleProfiler` — concrete implementation

### go.mod: clean (issue #613 resolved 2026-05-04)
Pinned to published `core v0.9.3`, `events v0.1.0`, `mechanics/effects v0.2.1`,
`dice v0.1.0`. No replace directives. `go test -race ./...` passes against
published versions.

---

## mechanics/spells — B-

**Path:** `mechanics/spells/`
**Module:** `github.com/KirkDiggler/rpg-toolkit/mechanics/spells`

Spell slots, concentration tracking, spell lists.

### Key types
- `SlotManager` — tracks spell slot usage by level
- `ConcentrationTracker` — manages concentration (one spell at a time)
- `SpellList` — list of known/prepared spells

### go.mod state (issue #617)
Six replace directives committed to main. Same situation as
`mechanics/conditions`: source uses old-API events symbols that don't exist
in any published events version. Closing #617 means rewriting against the
new typed-topic API. Tracked in **issue #617**, deferred until the playtest
exercises spells.

### Coverage note
Concentration logic, spell events, and slot management all have test files
and pass. Test style is mostly flat (not suite pattern). No known logic bugs.
