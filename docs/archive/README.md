## Why Archived?

These documents were moved to the archive to consolidate around a cleaner documentation structure:

- **Active ADRs** remain in `docs/adr/` as the formal record of decisions
- **Journey logs** remain in `docs/journey/` as the narrative of development
- **Future ideas** should use `docs/ideas/` when that structure is needed

The archived materials can be selectively restored or referenced as needed, but they're no longer part of the primary documentation structure.

## Using Archived Documentation

These documents remain valuable for:
- Understanding historical context
- Reviewing abandoned design alternatives
- Extracting patterns for new work
- Researching how specific features evolved

Feel free to reference these documents, but prefer current ADRs and journey logs for understanding the current state of the system.
