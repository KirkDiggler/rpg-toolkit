    },
    {
      "question": "What are special abilities?",
      "answer": "Features - same as character features",
      "reason": "Nimble Escape is a Feature that subscribes to events and modifies behavior, just like Rage or Second Wind."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should monsters select actions?",
      "answer": "Utility scoring - each action gets a score, highest valid score wins",
      "reason": "Simple, tunable, extensible. State machines can be integrated later as a proper toolkit tool."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are monster actions?",
      "answer": "Rich objects with type, cost, range, triggers, and effects",
