# Journey 016: MMO-Inspired Persistent World Vision - Always-On Cooperative D&D

**Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Context**: Exploring engagement mechanics from MMO industry experience applied to cooperative tabletop RPG  
**Status**: Vision Exploration  

## The Core Insight

**Problem**: Traditional tabletop RPGs only exist during scheduled sessions. Players lose engagement between games, momentum dies during scheduling gaps, and there's no sense of a living world.

**Solution**: Apply MMO industry engagement mechanics to cooperative D&D through a persistent world that continues evolving 24/7, accessible via Discord companion app.

## The Vision: Always-On Cooperative D&D

### What We're Building
A **persistent world cooperative D&D experience** that combines:
- **Gloomhaven**: Turn-based tactical combat with persistent campaign progression
- **Path of Exile**: Deep character customization with procedural content generation  
- **MMO Engagement**: World continues evolving between sessions with always-accessible interaction
- **D&D 5e**: Full ruleset with skills, backgrounds, and classes that matter mechanically

### The Persistent World Loop

**Between Sessions:**
1. **World Events Continue**: Merchants travel, factions move, weather changes, festivals occur
2. **Discord Engagement**: Players check world state, interact with NPCs, track progress
3. **Micro-Interactions**: Daily check-ins, relationship building, information gathering
4. **Anticipation Building**: Discoveries and changes create urgency for next session

**During Sessions:**
1. **World State Integration**: Current world state affects available content
2. **Party Synergy**: Cooperative mechanics that reward team composition
3. **Adaptive Content**: Encounters and opportunities that play to party strengths
4. **Persistent Consequences**: Actions affect future world state and engagement

## Technical Foundation

### Event-Driven Persistent World
```go
// World events that continue even when players aren't playing
type WorldStateEffect struct {
    CurrentEvents    []WorldEvent
    MerchantSchedule map[string]Schedule
    FactionStates    map[string]FactionState
    PlayerStatus     map[string]PlayerState
}

// Effect processes world changes over time
func (e *WorldStateEffect) OnEvent(event Event) {
    if event.Type == "time.day_passed" {
        e.ProcessDailyEvents()
        e.UpdateMerchantLocations()
        e.ProcessFactionActivities()
    }
}
```

### Discord Integration Architecture
- **Bot Commands**: Simple commands to check world state
- **Persistent Storage**: World state persists between sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: Players notified of important changes
- **Async Interactions**: Simple choices and activities

## Engagement Mechanics (MMO Industry Lessons)

### Daily Micro-Interactions
**The Wandering Merchant Check:**
```
/world-status
> The wandering merchant Grimsby is in Millhaven (2 days remaining)
> The Autumn Festival starts in 5 days
> Your faction standing with the Iron Guard: Friendly (+2)
> Weather: Heavy rain (travel time +1 day)
```

**NPC Relationship Tracking:**
```
/npc-status priest-johnson
> Father Johnson (Priest of Millhaven):
> Relationship: Friendly
> Last interaction: 3 days ago
> Available services: Healing, Curse removal, Blessings
> Recent news: "The temple received a donation from Lady Ashford"
```

### Persistent Activities
- **Research Projects**: Long-term scholarly pursuits that complete over time
- **Crafting Queues**: Items being created during downtime
- **Relationship Building**: Gradual NPC relationship improvement through interaction
- **Information Networks**: Gathering intelligence and rumors over time

### Social Coordination
- **Party Planning**: Schedule sessions, share discoveries
- **World Sharing**: Screenshots, notable events, achievements
- **Collective Activities**: Guild halls, shared projects
