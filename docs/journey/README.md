# The Journey

This directory contains the ongoing architectural journey of the RPG Toolkit. Unlike ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) which document final decisions, these documents capture:

- Questions we're grappling with
- Design explorations
- "Dragons" we've identified but not yet slain
- Lessons learned along the way

## Why Document the Journey?

1. **For Future Contributors**: Understanding why things are the way they are
2. **For Ourselves**: Remembering what we've already considered
3. **For the Community**: Open source is as much about the process as the result

## Current Documents

- [001: Architectural Dragons](001-architectural-dragons.md) - Big challenges we see ahead
- [002: Dice Roller Design](002-dice-roller-design.md) - Thinking through dice implementation
- [003: Event Participant Ecosystem](003-event-participant-ecosystem.md) - Event system architecture
- [004: Conditions System](004-conditions-system.md) - Status effects and relationships
- [005: Generics in Conditions](005-generics-in-conditions.md) - Type safety vs flexibility trade-offs

## Document Types

- **Dragons** üêâ: Architectural challenges and unknowns
- **Designs** üìê: Working through implementation approaches
- **Lessons** üí°: What we learned after implementing something
- **Questions** ‚ùì: Open questions we're still pondering

## Contributing

If you're exploring a design or wrestling with an architectural question, add a document here! Number it sequentially and give it a descriptive name.

Remember: This is about the journey, not the destination. It's okay to document ideas that don't work out - that's valuable learning too!
