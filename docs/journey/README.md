# The Journey

This directory contains the ongoing architectural journey of the RPG Toolkit. Unlike ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) which document final decisions, these documents capture:

- Questions we're grappling with
- Design explorations
- "Dragons" we've identified but not yet slain
- Lessons learned along the way

## Why Document the Journey?

1. **For Future Contributors**: Understanding why things are the way they are
2. **For Ourselves**: Remembering what we've already considered
3. **For the Community**: Open source is as much about the process as the result

## Current Documents

- [001: Architectural Dragons](001-architectural-dragons.md) - Big challenges we see ahead
- [002: Dice Package Design](002-dice-package-design.md) - Thinking through dice implementation

## Document Types

- **Dragons** 🐉: Architectural challenges and unknowns
- **Designs** 📐: Working through implementation approaches
- **Lessons** 💡: What we learned after implementing something
- **Questions** ❓: Open questions we're still pondering

## Contributing

If you're exploring a design or wrestling with an architectural question, add a document here! Number it sequentially and give it a descriptive name.

Remember: This is about the journey, not the destination. It's okay to document ideas that don't work out - that's valuable learning too!
