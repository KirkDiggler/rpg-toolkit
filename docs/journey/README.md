# The Journey

This directory contains the ongoing architectural journey of the RPG Toolkit. Unlike ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) which document final decisions, these documents capture:

- Questions we're grappling with
- Design explorations
- "Dragons" we've identified but not yet slain
- Lessons learned along the way

## Why Document the Journey?

1. **For Future Contributors**: Understanding why things are the way they are
2. **For Ourselves**: Remembering what we've already considered
3. **For the Community**: Open source is as much about the process as the result

## Contributing

If you're exploring a design or wrestling with an architectural question, add a document here! Number it sequentially and give it a descriptive name.

Remember: This is about the journey, not the destination. It's okay to document ideas that don't work out - that's valuable learning too!
