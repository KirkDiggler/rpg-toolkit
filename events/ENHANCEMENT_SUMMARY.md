# Event System Enhancement Summary

## Overview
The event system has been enhanced to match the Discord bot's features, providing a robust foundation for event-driven game mechanics.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Duration System ✅
- 10 duration types: Permanent, Rounds, Minutes, Hours, Encounter, Concentration, ShortRest, LongRest, UntilDamaged, UntilSave
- Each duration type has appropriate expiration logic
- Clean interface for checking expiration status

### 2. Type-Safe Event Types ✅
- Added `EventType` as int enum alongside string constants
- Dual access via `Type()` (string) and `TypedType()` (EventType)
- Maintains backward compatibility while providing type safety
- Automatic mapping between string and typed events

### 3. Context Key Constants ✅
- 100+ predefined context keys for common event data
- Prevents typos and ensures consistency
- Organized into logical groups (combat, rolls, saves, effects, etc.)

### 4. Typed Context Accessors ✅
- Type-safe methods: GetInt, GetString, GetBool, GetFloat64, GetEntity, GetDuration
- Returns (value, bool) for safe access
- Handles type mismatches gracefully

### 5. Enhanced Modifier System ✅
- Conditional modifiers with `Condition(event Event) bool`
- Duration support for temporary modifiers
- Rich source information via `ModifierSource` struct
- ModifierConfig for creating complex modifiers

### 6. Event Builder Pattern ✅
- Fluent API for event creation
- Methods: WithSource, WithTarget, WithContext, WithModifier
- Chainable for clean event construction

### 7. Event Cancellation ✅
- Events can be cancelled via `Cancel()`
- Event bus respects cancellation and stops processing
- Tested with comprehensive test case

## Testing
All features have comprehensive test coverage including:
- Unit tests for each duration type
- Tests for typed accessors with various data types
- Conditional modifier tests
- Event builder pattern tests
- Cancellation behavior tests
- Integration tests with event bus

## Migration Impact
The Discord bot can now:
1. Use the toolkit's event system directly
2. Remove its duplicate event implementation
3. Leverage all the enhanced features
4. Maintain existing functionality with improved infrastructure

## Next Steps
With the event system complete, the recommended priority order is:
1. **Feature System (#33)** - Essential for character abilities and traits
2. **Enhanced Conditions (#32)** - Advanced condition mechanics
3. **Equipment System (#31)** - Items and inventory management

The feature system would be the most impactful next step as it directly enables migrating character features from the Discord bot.
